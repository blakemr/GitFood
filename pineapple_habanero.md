# Pineapple Habanero Hot Sauce

Adapted from this [webpage](https://www.chilipeppermadness.com/chili-pepper-recipes/hot-sauces/pineapple-habanero-hot-sauce/)

## Ingredients

* 5-6 habanero peppers coarsely chopped (I use more)
* 2 cups chopped pineapple
* 1 handful cilantro leaves rinsed
* Juice from 1 lime
* 1 cup white vinegar
* Â½ teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Add all ingredients to a food processor or blender and process until smooth.
2. Add to a pot and simmer over low heat for at least 15 minutes.
3. Cool and strain, if desired. If you want a chunkier hot sauce, skip the straining. Or, strain and add a bit of the pulp back in to your desired consistency.
4. Pour into bottles and refrigerate until ready to use!
